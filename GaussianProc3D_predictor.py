Ideally, this script should
take (user?) inputs to determine x_predicted, y_predicte, and z_predicted arrays (again, cool with augmenting lines in code, especially this one, which probably won't need to change much in the next 4-5 days I'll be using it).
take inputs from the second script to enter in data (that is, the temperature (T_time_avg_3d) and position (xyz_observed) data that was augmented in the second script).
output the interpolated data. Specifically, T_prediction, y_prediction_MSE, and sigma.

Having at least the GP interpolation as a function
